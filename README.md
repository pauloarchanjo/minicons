# Minicons

Welcome to Minicons! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of SVG logos curated and enhanced for various uses, particularly for integration in personal projects. Currently, the repository includes logos in six different style types: "plain," "light-bg," "dark-bg," "gradient," "light-gray," and "dark-gray."

## How to use

To use logos from this repository, you have these options:

1. **Copy the URL**: Each logo has a unique URL. You can copy the URL of the image to use it. This is useful if you want to reference or embed the logo on a website or document. The URL will remain stable and linked to the logo in the repository.

2. **Download**: Another way to use the logo is to download it directly from the repository. To do this, click "Download raw file". This will download the .svg file to your computer, where you can use it as needed.

A big advantage of "Minicons" is using logos in .svg format. Because they are vector, it means they can be resized without loss of quality. Unlike raster images (such as .jpg or .png), .svg files maintain sharpness and visual definition regardless of the size at which they are displayed.
